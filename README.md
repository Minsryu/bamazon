Hello this is an Bamazon App! I will guide you how to use the app as customer who can purchase products and manager who over looks inventory and restock if low.

1. Customer
	1. First you run the app by typing "node bamazonCustomer.js" in terminal.
	2. Type in the id of the product you want to purchase.
	3. Next the quantity. (Make sure to check the quantity, if entered less than stock it will give you an error)
	4. Once both are selected it will give you the total amount needed to purchase.

		1. View products for sale - this will give you information of all products that are currently in sale
